Honourable Mentions:
- Jonhan: Introduced good check concepts to newcomers in the community.
- Hydrogen: Could be on the list but I haven't tested his work that much, seems decent though.
- Kyle/Jacob (Verus Developers): Made the top tier anticheat of 2018 but they've fell behind a lot.
- Retrooper: Not an anticheat developer but develops one of the leading Packet APIs used by many anticheats recently.
- Gson: Frequency developer, though I haven't seen much of his work at all.
